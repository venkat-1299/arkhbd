        To a girl that's born on 2005, üéÄ<br /><br />
        While our conversations have been brief and our interactions fleeting, I
        find myself writing this and looking back at this sweet friendship I
        never thought I'd stumble up on, that's filled with fun, gossips,
        laughs, and silliness. As you celebrate another trip around the sun, I
        want to take this opportunity to extend my sincerest wishes for your
        happiness. Though I may not know too much about you or your life and
        even your complete personality just yet, despite irritating you a couple
        of times, ignoring youuuu..... I am certain that the world is a brighter
        and a special place with you in it üí´. Here's to hoping that this year
        brings you countless reasons to smile, moments of serenity, less creeps
        around you, people that annoy you lesss and unexpected blessings that
        leave you in awe and ofc making you all excited and feeling special for
        the ever-growing year, AND DEFINTELY PEAACEEE. So, as you blow out the
        candles on your cake and make a wish.... here I am, Wishing the
        brightest, most beautiful birthday to a girl that's turning 19 ‚ú®, who
        lights up every room with her smile, who's sweeet, fun, funny,
        absolutely wonderful with an amazing personality with a lil bit of
        angerr! May your day be filled with endless joy, laughter, and all the
        love you deserveeee. ü•≥ Here's to another fabulous year ahead, filled
        with adventures waiting to be embraced, dreams waiting to be chased, and
        memories waiting to be made. Happy Birthday once again, to someone I
        consider more than a friend - you're family (sounds deeeep but I do find
        you as a girl that's speical enough to be my sisterrr üòÅ), despite not
        being blood related, I believe that you are someone I find realllllyy
        amazing and cool with how you handle life and people! I'm proud of the
        things that you've managed to achieive so far and how you carry
        yourself, how strong and confident you are in what you believe in, and
        I'm happy for all the things you'll achieve in your lifee. I'm glad I
        met you and am grateful to be able to call you my friend, and my
        sister...whom I wanna support and protect üíô. Here's to many more days
        of laughter, discovery, exploration, and shared moments, both online and
        beyond. May your journey be marked by love that knows no bounds and
        experiences that enrich your soul. Today and always, may you be
        surrounded by the warmth of friendship, the comfort of love, and the
        magic of dreams coming true. Wishing you a day filled with laughter,
